# edX-Capstone-CYO-Project
This project is a part of the Harvard 125.9x "Data Science: Capstone Choose Your Own Project".

The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Different machine learning models were tested.

The bibtex file contains the library, the script cyo_capstone_project_RScript.R saves all data in a .RData file which is imported by the .Rmd script to generate the report.
